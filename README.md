# GIPHY-API

### Overview

Quick and simple excersie in APIs, working on setting up keys, connections, and exchanging data.

In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. This task is done with the GIPHY API, JavaScript, and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.
